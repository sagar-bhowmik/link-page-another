		<p><strong>Sylhet</strong> is popular for its lakes and other water bodies, and it is also home to many tea gardens and small tropical forests. Ratargul Swamp forest, which is a freshwater swamp forest, is the most iconic place to visit here, closely followed by Jaflong and Bisanakandi. You can view some truly jaw-dropping feats of nature in these forests, unlike anywhere else on Earth. A 14th-century Muslim saint Shah Jalal is buried in this very district. His burial site has been turned into a shrine and is known as Shahjalal Dargah, which is visited by millions of people all year round.Sylhet also has many beautiful tea gardens and several museums worth checking out. If you want to taste the unique cuisine of the district, drop by at Panshi or Paanch Bhai for a quick lunch or dinner. Utterly divine!</p>
