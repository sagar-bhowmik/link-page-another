		<p><strong>Old Dhaka!</strong> Sitting on the bank of the Buriganga River, Old Dhaka’s rich culture and heritage are reflected in both its architecture and the lifestyle of the city’s population. Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh, and the southernmost region of the city is called Old Dhaka.Among the landmarks in Old Dhaka, the Lalbagh Fort and Ahsan Manjil are two of the most visited sites. The former is an incomplete fort from Mughal times. The latter housed the Nawabs and is built upon the rich Mughal architectural principles.</p><br>
